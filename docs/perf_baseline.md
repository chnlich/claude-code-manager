# Perf baseline

Latency-perf baseline for the hourly cron in `prompts/cron/latency_perf.md`: metric definitions
with healthy ranges, seed measurements from the landing day, and the sampling history. Each round
compares its measurements against the healthy ranges here and lands at most one fix. This file
changes only through pull requests: a fix PR appends its sampling-history row, a PR that
introduces a metric with no row here adds that metric's definition row and history row in the same
PR, and a calibration-only round may open a docs-only PR of under 50 lines.

| M60 chat message-body markdown parse, repeat page render | M60 collector below | ms per 40-body page render pass over the worst on-disk live chat file (the cold first render is reported, not the metric — since the deferral PR it splits into a deferred-parse slice and a highlight-flush slice); the repeat is the session re-entry / re-render shape — every session switch rebuilds the turn engine and re-renders the same bodies | repeat median < 0.5 ms; cold first paint < 50 ms deferred-parse + the flush slice carrying the deferred highlight | — (introduced with its first history row) |
| M61 session-metadata read after TTL expiry, idle-cold | M61 collector below | ms per listing/get_session over the live corpus with every cache entry aged past `_METADATA_CACHE_TTL` (archived entries never expire; the idle cost is the non-archived set's revalidation) | bare listing median < 2 ms; single get_session median < 0.1 ms | — (introduced with its first history row) |

| M72 file-browser directory listing | M72 collector below | seconds per `GET /files/<dir>` request, worst on-disk listing corpus (the sessions root); the changed-round rebuild (one corpus move since the stored page keyed — a metadata rename into a session dir; the harness drops the page memo per timed round, row memo warm, builder level) | repeat-view median < 0.008 s; changed-round median < 0.007 s | — (introduced with its first history row) |
| M73 plan-verb validation event-loop lag | M73 collector below | seconds of loop lag + wall per amend validation (the registration gate: the DOM assertion set plus the headless-Chrome page-height render), scratch home, copied passing plan page (loop lag reads the 5 ms ticker floor like M14) | loop-lag median < 0.010 s; wall median < 0.2 s (warm steady state; the first validation after a process start pays the one-time browser launch) | — (introduced with its first history row) |

| M80 token-tally changed round under append churn | M80 collector below | seconds per changed-round collect after one 1 MB-class append to each of the two worst copied transcripts (the busy-turn shape: an active master turn appends MBs between /token-usage loads; the 40 h live log sampled 2026-09-09 shows the page's p90 at 219 ms, max 2.35 s, against a 20 ms warm median), scratch corpus + cache | median < 0.30 s (recalibrated from < 0.020 s: the charlie-bot source's 2.3 GB / 20.5k-directory corpus joined every collect's walk in #1352, and the memoized walk's one-stat-per-directory floor on this host is ~0.1 s; the 2026-09-10 landing's 0.0030-0.0048 s readings predate that source) | — (introduced with its first history row) |

| M97 plan-CLI command wall, common-family verb | M97 collector below | seconds per `charliebot plan list --session <sid>` wall (fresh process: the plan chain's import+dispatch plus the live GET; a verb command — present/amend/approve/close — pays the same floor plus its POST, the server side validates) | median < 0.40 s | — (introduced with its first history row) |
| M98 memory-CLI invocation wall, read verb | M98 collector below | seconds per `charliebot memory query --topic <t> --index` wall (fresh process: the memory chain's import+dispatch plus the live store read; a replay/experiment/compare verb pays the replay stack it runs) | median < 0.30 s | — (introduced with its first history row) |

Note — every healthy range is provisional: a single-sample calibration from the 2026-08-30 seed
measurements against the design intent (load below the CPU count, serve CPU total well under
machine capacity, API median in the low tens of milliseconds, zero hung sessions). The serve CPU
ceiling sits at 75 % of the 4-CPU capacity because every round's reading includes its own worker
process, a constant bias. The M2 seed depends on how many browser tabs hold the dashboard open.
Any PR's Evidence section may recalibrate a range; the new value lands with that PR.

## Collector commands

The exact commands behind the seed values, run verbatim by the cron; the cron prompt does not
duplicate them — this file is their single home.

M1 — host load and serve CPU:

```bash
uptime
ps -eo pcpu,args | grep '[o]pencode serve' | awk '{n++; s+=$1} END {printf "%d serve processes, %.1f%% cpu total\n", n, s}'
```

M2 — UI poll rate and server-log size, from the newest server log (its filename carries the server
start time; polls per hour is the status-request count divided by hours since that start):

```bash
LOG=$(ls -1t /tmp/charliebot-logs/server_*.log | head -1); python3 -c '
import os, re, sys, time
log = sys.argv[1]
start = time.mktime(time.strptime(re.search(r"server_(\d{8}_\d{6})", log).group(1), "%Y%m%d_%H%M%S"))
hours = (time.time() - start) / 3600
with open(log, errors="replace") as f:
    n = sum(1 for line in f if "sessions/status" in line or "tui/status" in line)
print(f"{n} status requests over {hours:.2f} h = {n / hours:.0f} polls/h; {os.path.getsize(log) / 1e6:.1f} MB")
' "$LOG"
```

M3 — API latency: the status check, then five credential-free timed requests (the 401 path — no
auth header; the timing reads the middleware-and-framework floor of the server path):

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w 'http_code=%{http_code} time_total=%{time_total}s\n' http://127.0.0.1:18498/api/sessions/status
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{time_total}\n' http://127.0.0.1:18498/api/sessions/status; done | sort -n | awk '{a[NR]=$1} END {printf "median %.3f s, max %.3f s over %d requests\n", a[int((NR+1)/2)], a[NR], NR}'
```

M4 — turn durations and hung sessions. The projection reads only `type` and `timestamp` from chat
events and `status` from thread and session metadata; session content is never read. A session whose
own metadata says `archived` is never hung — archiving is the user's statement that the session is
finished, the same rule the boot recovery applies (`_session_archived`), so the stale `running`
thread markers an archived session keeps do not count; the session metadata is read only when a
thread claims `running`, so the common scan pays nothing extra:

```bash

print(line)
EOF
```

M5 — threads/list latency for the session with the most thread metadata files on disk (the worst
case the 3 s workers-panel poll can hit; the key is read read-only from the host credentials):

```bash
KEY=$(awk '/^charliebot:/{f=1;next} f&&/^  access_key:/{print $2;exit}' ~/.charliebot/credentials.yaml); read SID N <<<"$(python3 -c '

        if n > best_n:
            best, best_n = d, n

```

M6 — session usage latency for the session with the most lines in its live `chat_events.jsonl` (the
worst case the 3 s active-session-view poll can hit while that session is thinking; only the live
file feeds resolution, archived events do not):

```bash
KEY=$(awk '/^charliebot:/{f=1;next} f&&/^  access_key:/{print $2;exit}' ~/.charliebot/credentials.yaml); read SID N <<<"$(python3 -c '

            n = sum(1 for _ in f)
        if n > best_n:
            best, best_n = d, n
print(best.name, best_n)

```

M6 append-round — usage resolution during a streamed turn. The standing collector above reads
the live instance, where the unchanged-list memo serves every poll; the streamed-turn shape
appends one chat event per delta, so a poll's resolution must fold only the appended suffix
into the carried fold state instead of re-scanning the whole history. A round writes state,
so the collector copies the session whose live chat file carries the most events into a
scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp (metadata.json and data/ only; live home read once for
the copy, never written), warms the fold as the view's first resolution does, then appends
one probe event before each timed resolution — the poll-during-a-streamed-turn shape —
asserting the resolved usage equals a fresh full-scan reference:

M7 — token-usage page load: five timed requests of the rendered page, each asserted 200 —
a 500 arrives as fast as a warm 200 (the collect finishes, the render raises), so a
status-blind timing reads a down page as healthy latency (the 2026-09-11 21:43 deploy-skew
outage read 5x500/hour for 8+ hours of rounds before a 500-blind sweep exposed it). The page
builds a persisted tally cache covering all three sources: per-file entries for the gigabyte-scale
Claude logs and the hundred-megabyte Codex rollouts, and one entry for the opencode db's
whole contribution signatured on the main file plus its `-wal` sidecar (a WAL-mode write
leaves the main file untouched, so the main file's stat alone can never see it). The first
load after a server start (or after bulk log churn) is a full scan, later loads re-scan
only the sources that changed, so the five-request median reads the warm steady state
(~2 s at the seed host's 2.2 GB + 190 MB log volume, measured before the Codex logs joined
the cache — hence the provisional 3 s ceiling). Evidence while the live server runs older
code is a scratch-instance
A/B: live-before against this instance, scratch-after against a scratch server on the changed
code with a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` (its own empty cache directory — cold-then-warm measures
both paths):

```bash
KEY=$(awk '/^charliebot:/{f=1;next} f&&/^  access_key:/{print $2;exit}' ~/.charliebot/credentials.yaml); for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{time_total}\n' -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" http://127.0.0.1:18498/token-usage; done | sort -k2 -n | awk '{c[$1]++; a[NR]=$2} END {if (c[200] != NR) {printf "M7 FAILED, non-200 statuses:"; for (s in c) printf " %dx%s", c[s], s; print ""; exit 1} printf "median %.3f s, max %.3f s over %d requests\n", a[int((NR+1)/2)], a[NR], NR}'
```

M7 changed-round — the collect behind a page load whose corpus moved since the last one (any
grown log moves the walk signature): the persisted document re-parses, unchanged files serve
from it, and the db row memo re-proves its rows. The standing collector's five back-to-back
requests never cross a corpus move, so the changed round needs its own timing: the harness
drops the in-process memos per round and restores a scratch copy of the live document (live
home read once for the copy, never written), keeping the row memos warm as the running
server's are:

```bash
/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot/.venv/bin/python - <<'EOF'

    # per-file signatures are stale for exactly the files that moved; the row memos stay
    # warm, as the long-running server's are.
    tt._aggregate_memo = None
    tt._tally_memo = None

    tally = tt.collect_token_usage(cache_path=SCRATCH)

      f"{len(tally.rows)} rows, {tally.scanned_bytes / 1e6:.1f} MB re-read")
EOF
```

M7 restart-cold — the collect behind the first page load after a server start: a fresh
process re-parses the persisted document, rebuilds the row memo from its stored rows map,
and diffs one key pass against the live db, so only rows that moved since the document was
written re-enter the parser (live home read once for the copy, never written):

```bash
/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot/.venv/bin/python - <<'EOF'
import hashlib, json, shutil, sys, time
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.insert(0, "/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot")

t0 = time.perf_counter()
tally = tt.collect_token_usage(cache_path=SCRATCH)
wall = time.perf_counter() - t0
rows = [[r.source, r.model, r.calls, r.in_fresh, r.cache_write, r.cache_read, r.output] for r in tally.rows]

      f"scanned {tally.scanned_bytes / 1e6:.1f} MB, rows digest {digest}")
EOF
```

M8 — sidebar search latency, worst case: five timed requests for a needle absent from every
active session's live chat file, so each request scans the whole searchable corpus (active
sessions' `chat_events.jsonl`) without an early hit. Evidence while the live server runs older
code is a scratch-instance A/B on the search corpus (all session metadata plus active sessions'
live chat files), the same shape as the M7 protocol.

```bash
KEY=$(awk '/^charliebot:/{f=1;next} f&&/^  access_key:/{print $2;exit}' ~/.charliebot/credentials.yaml); for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{time_total}\n' -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:18498/api/sessions/search?q=zzq9xneverpresentneedle77"; done | sort -n | awk '{a[NR]=$1} END {printf "median %.3f s, max %.3f s over %d requests\n", a[int((NR+1)/2)], a[NR], NR}'
```

M9 — ext-usage poller codex spend rescan, steady state. The poller's cost is background work invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector times the function the poller calls every round: the provider's spend computation over the live corpus (read-only), from the main repo checkout. The collector reports the no-churn steady state; a round where a rollout file changed re-parses just that file, and one cold full-corpus pass runs per server process start:

```bash
/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot/.venv/bin/python - <<'EOF'
import sys, time
sys.path.insert(0, "/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot")
from pathlib import Path
from src.api.ext_usage import CodexUsageProvider, _list_rollout_files

prov = CodexUsageProvider("main", str(Path.home() / ".codex"))
rollouts = _list_rollout_files(prov.sessions_dir)
prov._compute_spend(rollouts)  # cold pass, as at a server restart; not timed
times = []
for _ in range(5):
    t0 = time.perf_counter()
    prov._compute_spend(rollouts)
    times.append(time.perf_counter() - t0)
times.sort()
print(f"{len(rollouts)} rollout files; steady-state spend rescan median {times[2]:.4f} s, max {times[-1]:.4f} s")
EOF
```

M10 — thread-metadata torn reads: the invariant behind the threads/list endpoint's writes.
`list_threads` validates every thread's `metadata.json` from an executor thread with no
coordination against `save_metadata`'s rewrite, so a save that publishes the file
truncated lets a concurrent poll observe a half-written file; that read fails
`ThreadMetadata` validation and 500s the whole list response (the same failure the
3 s workers-panel poll hits). The collector cannot drive that race through HTTP on the
live instance without writing to its state, so it reproduces the race against the main
checkout's code with scratch state: 3000 `save_metadata` calls on one thread's file
while four reader threads validate every read. A torn read under this stream is a read
the fixed write path cannot produce; the count is the metric.

M11 — backlog read endpoints' status codes. This host configures no
`ui.backlog_repos`, so both GETs read the empty-state path, and every 500 arrives
with a ~30-line ASGI traceback in the server log beside its structured
`http_request … status=500` line (the line the 5xx count below matches — the
server switched from uvicorn's `"GET … HTTP/1.1" 500` access-log shape to these
structured lines, which the count must follow). The count appends `|| [ $? -eq 1 ]`
because `grep -c` exits 1 on the healthy zero count: a real grep failure (exit 2)
stays loud, a zero count exits clean. Evidence while the live server runs older
code is a scratch-instance
A/B (scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME`, TestClient against before and after code), the
same shape as the M7 protocol.

M12 — ext-usage poller codex usage scrape, steady state. The scrape reads each account's
newest rollout every round for the latest token_count event; the collector times the function
the poller calls each round over the live corpus (read-only), from the main repo checkout. An
unchanged file is the steady state; a changed file re-reads only its tail window (the
full-file read remains for a token_count farther back than the window):

```bash
/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot/.venv/bin/python - <<'EOF'
import sys, time
sys.path.insert(0, "/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot")

rollouts = _list_rollout_files(prov.sessions_dir)
prov._fetch_usage(rollouts)  # cold pass, as at a server restart; not timed
times = []
for _ in range(5):
    t0 = time.perf_counter()
    prov._fetch_usage(rollouts)
    times.append(time.perf_counter() - t0)

print(f"{len(rollouts)} rollout files; steady-state usage scrape median {times[2]:.4f} s, max {times[-1]:.4f} s")

```

M13 — thread-events read+transform, steady state. The workers panel polls
`GET /api/threads/{sid}/threads/{tid}/events` every 5 s for each expanded
running worker, and the endpoint projects the worker's whole events log on
every call. The cost is invisible to HTTP probes of the standing metrics, so
the collector times the function the handler calls over the largest on-disk
worker log (read-only), from the main repo checkout. An unchanged log is the
steady state (one stat); a log appended between calls re-parses only its new
tail; a shrunk log restarts its entry from scratch. Evidence while the live
server runs older code is a scratch-instance A/B, the same shape as the M7
protocol:

M14 — git diff API event-loop lag. The diff endpoints run `git` subprocesses whose duration
is user data (up to SUBPROCESS_GIT_DIFF_TIMEOUT per call, several calls per request); run
inline in the async handler, that time is an event-loop freeze for every concurrent request
and WebSocket, invisible to the standing probes above. The collector drives the `diff_files`
handler over the charlie-bot checkout's full history (root commit .. HEAD — the largest
range this host's workspace carries) with a concurrent 5 ms ticker, and reports the worst
ticker gap per run; when the handler never yields, every gap is the handler's whole wall
time. Evidence while the live server runs older code points the same collector at the
branch checkout, the same shape as the M7 protocol (both runs are read-only against live
state: the scratch CHARLIEBOT_HOME is a tempfile):

M15 — recap-summary cache torn reads: the invariant behind the recap view's
cache writes. `get_session_recap` reads `recap_summaries.json` from an executor
thread with no coordination against `_write_cache_entry`'s rewrite from the
summarize handler, so a write that publishes the file truncated lets a
concurrent read observe a half-written file; that read fails json parsing and
500s the recap response. The collector reproduces the race against the main
checkout's code with scratch state: 3000 `_write_cache_entry` calls on one
session's cache file while four reader threads run the handler's lookup. A torn
read under this stream is a read the fixed write path cannot produce; the count
is the metric. The reader loop yields every 8 reads: a memo-hit lookup is
shorter than the interpreter's 5 ms GIL switch request, so a yield-free reader
starves the writer of the GIL indefinitely and the stream never finishes. The
yield keeps the write stream moving with the readers still running throughout.
Evidence while the live server runs older code points the same
collector at the branch checkout (`sys.path.insert` at the worktree root).

M16 — trigger-file torn reads: the invariant behind the trigger files the polls read.
`_save_trigger` rewrites a trigger's JSON on schedule/cancel/fire while
`list_triggers` (the 3 s workers-panel poll, the session view) and the sidebar
probe (`pending_trigger_state_sync`) read it from executor threads with no
coordination; a save that publishes the file truncated lets a concurrent read
observe a half-written file, fail JSON parsing, and drop the trigger from that
poll's list and pending count. The collector reproduces the race against the
checkout's code with scratch state: 3000 `_save_trigger` calls on one trigger's
file while four reader threads run the read path (`read_text` +
`_migrate_legacy_watch_pids`). A torn read under this stream is a read the
fixed write path cannot produce; the count is the metric. Evidence while the

M17 — session fork (clone) latency: the endpoint behind `POST /api/sessions/{id}/fork`,
`SessionManager.fork_session`, parses the parent's archived and live chat events and
re-serializes them into the child's `data/parent_reference.jsonl`, appends the clone event,
and copies plan artifacts file by file, so the wall time scales with the parent's chat-event
bytes while the `threads/` payload — often the bulk of a session's directory size — is never
read. A fork writes state, so the live instance cannot be probed read-only; the collector
resolves the session with the heaviest fork corpus (live chat events plus archives), copies
only that session into a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp, and times `fork_session` from
the main checkout, one cold pass then five timed forks. Evidence while the live server runs

M18 — hidden-tab periodic poll fetches: the invariant behind page-timers.js
("a hidden tab does no periodic work at all"). A poll routined around the
registry keeps fetching while the tab is hidden (browser throttling slows but
never stops a raw interval). The collector loads the checkout's real
page-timers.js, workers.js and ext_usage.js in a node vm with a stub document,
holds the page hidden, starts one expanded running worker's thread-detail poll
plus the ext-usage strip's DOMContentLoaded init, and fires every registered
interval the number of times its cadence fits a simulated 10 minutes. Fetches
issued after bootstrap settle are the metric; healthy is 0. The closing 10 s
visible re-check must fetch again (a poll that never resumes is a finding, not
a pass). Evidence while the live server runs older code points the same

M19 — SSE line framing of a chunked large-frame stream. `iter_sse_lines` frames
both opencode master/worker event streams and the anthropic-proxy upstream, and
its terminator-search cost is invisible to the HTTP probes above: a frame spans
as many byte chunks as the network delivers, so when the search re-scans the
accumulated remainder on every chunk, framing costs O(bytes × chunks) — seconds
of blocked event-loop time per multi-MB tool payload at network chunk sizes —
while a resumable search stays O(bytes). The production consumers read the
byte mode (`lines_as_bytes=True`), whose lines skip the chunk decode the
pre-byte framer paid for their JSON parsers (orjson parses the wire's UTF-8
bytes natively); the collector streams a
16 MB payload of ~1 MB frames (terminators at frame ends only) through the
adapter at a fixed 16 KB chunking against the checkout's code, synthetic and
read-only, in the byte mode the serve path runs. Evidence points the same

M20 — recap extract repeats at one divider. `GET /api/sessions/{id}/recap?upto=…`
runs `extract_recap`, which parses and projects every event below the divider; the
chat UI re-requests an open recap panel on every re-materialization (virtualized
scrolling, turn re-renders), so each repeat pays a full corpus scan for an
unchanged result and the cost is invisible to the standing HTTP probes. The
collector copies the worst on-disk extract corpus (the session whose live chat
file plus archives carry the most bytes — the corpus extraction parses;
metadata.json plus data/ only) into a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp and
times `extract_recap` from the checkout, one cold pass then five timed repeats at

for the copy, never written), warms the events cache as the viewed session's polls do,
then times the first extract at six unseen dividers (0.70-0.95 of the corpus) — each
divider a distinct memo key, so every timed round is a genuine cold extract:

M21 — sidebar 10th-poll probe sweep, steady state. Every 10th `/api/sessions/status`
poll re-selects every active session for a sidebar re-probe (the self-heal window for
a writer that forgot its dirty mark). The pre-fix sweep deep-probed all of them — a
scandir+stat plus a read+parse of every 30-day-window thread metadata, every trigger
file, and every plans.json — where the fixed sweep pays one stat-only signature pass
per session and deep-probes only sessions whose probe inputs changed (the escape
hatch `/status?force=1` still deep-probes everything). The every-10th sweep
runs detached from the poll's request (single-flight; its results land for the
polls that follow it), so the cost is background work invisible to HTTP
probes, and the collector times the sweep function the poll schedules
(read-only over the live state), with the poll's on-loop signature storage
replayed between sweeps. The steady state is no probe input changed between sweeps; the cold
pass, as at a server start with no signatures stored, is a full deep probe and is not
timed. The pre-fix number used in the landing PR's evidence is the same sweep-shaped
command against `probe_sidebar_state_sync` unconditionally (the poll's pre-fix call).

M22 — ext-usage unknown-limit-shape warning stream, steady state. Every account
fetch re-runs the response transform (`_transform_response` with
`_scoped_windows`, `_transform_codex_response` with `_codex_windows`), and each
unrecognized utilization-bearing field or unmappable scoped entry logs
`ext_usage_unknown_limit_shape`; a field the upstream keeps sending re-fires the
same warning every fetch round forever — 1536 lines in the 20.47 h live server
log sampled 2026-09-01 (~75/h, 20 % of the log's structured lines) — while one
sighting per process carries the whole signal. The cost is background log volume
invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector drives the pure transform directly
over a synthetic response shaped like the observed one (two unknown top-level
utilization fields plus one scoped entry missing its percent): one first-sighting
call, as at a process start, then 60 steady-state repeat rounds, counting the
event. A warning in the repeat window is a re-fired alarm; the count is the
metric. Evidence while the live server runs older code points the same collector

M23 — archive-range chat-event rescan, steady state. Sessions with
`archive_offset > 0` paginate backwards through `load_chat_events_range`,
whose archive half re-read and re-scanned every archive file below the page
end on every page click (and on every cold recap extract touching archives).
The fixed reader memoizes each archive file's parsed events on
(mtime_ns, size): a repeat range read over unchanged archives pays one stat
per file and zero corpus bytes, mirroring the live events cache that
unarchived sessions already serve from. Archive files are append-only within
their week and frozen after, so the key is sound; a same-week recycle append
re-parses only that file. The cost is invisible to HTTP probes of archived
sessions (deep page turns only), so the collector copies the session whose
`data/archives` carries the most bytes into a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME`
under /tmp (metadata.json and data/ only; live home read once for the copy,
never written), warms the metadata cache as the live server's polls do, and
times 8-page backwards scrolls of 200 events below the archive end — one
cold pass, as at first scroll after a server start with an empty memo, then
five timed repeats. Evidence while the live server runs older code points

M24 — trigger list, steady state. The 3 s workers-panel poll
(`GET /api/threads/{sid}/list`) and the session view render call
`TriggerManager.list_triggers`, whose pre-fix form read and parsed every
trigger file of the session on every call. The cost is invisible to the
standing HTTP probes (panels poll the sessions they have open, not the worst
corpus), so the collector resolves the session whose triggers directory
carries the most files and times the manager function the poll awaits
(read-only over the live state), from the main repo checkout: one cold pass,
as at a server start with an empty memo, then five timed calls. The fixed
reader memoizes each trigger file's parsed record on (mtime_ns, size): the
steady state is one scandir and zero corpus bytes, and a `_save_trigger`
rewrite (schedule/cancel/fire) re-reads only that file. Trigger files change
only through that atomic rewrite, so the key is sound. Evidence while the
live server runs older code points the same collector at the branch checkout

M25 — scheduler config reload, steady state. Every 60 s scheduler tick re-reads the
config so edited cron tasks take effect without a restart; the pre-fix form ran a full
YAML parse and model validation inline on the event loop on every tick, while the fixed
form routes through the process-wide fingerprint-cached `get_config` — one stat-key
comparison when nothing changed, a real reload only on a fingerprint change (which still
lands within one tick, the same freshness the per-tick read guaranteed). Ticks are
background work invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector drives
`Scheduler._reload_config` over the live config corpus (read-only: a parse, never a
write) with a concurrent 5 ms ticker, from the checkout under test: one cold pass, as
at a server start, then five timed steady-state reloads (a reload faster than the
ticker cadence reports its own wall time). Evidence while the live server runs older

M26 — message-projection advance per appended event. The chat bootstrap
(`GET /api/sessions/{id}/bootstrap`, session view, SPA switches) and the
events pagination endpoint serve from the per-session message projection;
every one of those reads on a session whose live chat file grew since the
last read re-derived the projection from scratch — a full re-aggregation of
every event, ~59 ms on the 20534-event worst live corpus, per SPA switch or
page click on an appending session. The fixed projection is append-
incremental: `stable_closed_prefix_len` splits the raw stream at the last
point no open OpenCode run interval crosses, the closed prefix feeds the
aggregator exactly once, and the still-open tail is re-evaluated per call
through a cloned aggregator, so an advance costs O(open tail) instead of
O(history) while the served view still equals `events_to_view(all_events)`.
The split rule is sound because the stable-history projection defers queued
users only within one completed run interval; a shrinking live file (rewind)
still pays a full rebuild. The cost is a per-interaction latency no standing
probe sees, so the collector copies the session with the most live chat
events into a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp (metadata.json and data/
only; live home read once for the copy, never written), builds the
projection once (cold pass, as at first view after a server start; not
timed), then appends one event at a time and times the per-append advance,
checking the served view against the whole-list reference digest. Evidence

M27 — plans registry tolerant read, steady state. The plan panel's poll
endpoint (`GET /api/sessions/{id}/plans`) and the sidebar deep probe both run
`read_plans_tolerant`, whose pre-fix form read and parsed the session's
plans.json and re-derived every plan's state on every call. The cost is
invisible to the standing HTTP probes (the panel polls the session it has
open, not the worst corpus), so the collector times the function over the
session whose plans.json carries the most bytes (read-only over the live
state), from the checkout under test: one cold pass, as at a server start
with an empty memo, then five timed calls. The fixed reader memoizes each
plans.json's projected result on (mtime_ns, size): the steady state is one
exists+stat pair and zero registry bytes, and a verb's rewrite re-reads only
that file. Registry writes go through `write_json_atomically` and the derived
state is a pure function of the file content, so the key is sound. Evidence

M28 — ndjson tail+count scan, steady state. The chat paging paths for sessions
without a message projection (``archive_offset > 0`` — bootstrap, view, and events
pages) call ``parse_ndjson_tail`` on every request, and its count half must scan
the whole live file to report ``total_line_count`` (``count_ndjson_lines`` is the
same scan for the recap default divider and the session GET). The pre-fix form
walked the file line by line in Python — and even ``bytes.count`` measures only
~0.7 GB/s on this host — while the fixed form counts newlines per 1 MiB chunk
through a numpy SIMD compare (~3.4 GB/s measured), keeping the file-iteration
count contract (an unterminated final line counts) that the tail result's global
ordinal math depends on. The cost is per page view, invisible to the standing
HTTP probes, so the collector times both functions over the largest live chat
file on disk (read-only), from the checkout under test: one cold pass, as at a

M29 — session-metadata listing preamble, steady state. The status poll
(`GET /api/sessions/status`), the sessions list, the archived pages, and search
all route through `_load_session_metas`, whose first step lists the session
directories; this host's sessions root holds ~1000 dirs, so the pre-fix
`Path.iterdir()` + `is_dir()` form rebuilt a Path per entry and paid one stat()
each (~6 ms measured), while the fixed `os.scandir` pass answers `is_dir()` from
the directory record itself (~1 ms), itself memoized on the root's own
(mtime_ns, size) — the mtime moves exactly when a session entry is created or
removed — so a repeat listing with an unchanged root pays one stat (~5 µs,
signature taken before the scan so a racing create/delete re-scans next call).
The cost is a slice of every listing call
and stays invisible to the standing HTTP probes (a poll's total keeps its own
budget), so the collector times the manager function the listings await
(read-only over the live state), from the checkout under test: one cold pass,
as at a server start with an empty metadata cache, then nine timed calls. The
steady state is every metadata cache entry fresh (TTL-fresh or archived), so a
call pays the dir scan plus cache lookups and zero file reads. Evidence while
the live server runs older code points the same collector at the branch
checkout (`CHECKOUT` at the worktree root), the same shape as the M18 protocol:

```bash

M30 — live-half chat-event range rescan, steady state. Archived sessions
(``archive_offset > 0``) paginate backwards through ``load_chat_events_range``,
whose live half re-read the live file from byte 0 on every page click (and on
every cold recap extract touching the live tail) while the archive half already
served repeats from the M23 memo. The fixed reader memoizes the live file's
per-physical-line parsed events on (mtime_ns, size) for archived sessions —
the range index domain is physical lines (blank and malformed lines consume an
index, mirroring ``parse_ndjson_range``) — so a repeat scroll over an unchanged
live file pays one stat per page and zero corpus bytes; an append re-parses
once. The memo is gated to archived sessions: unarchived ones paginate through
the M26 message projection, so their range callers never reuse a moving live
corpus. The cost is invisible to HTTP probes of archived sessions (deep page
turns only), so the collector copies the archived session whose live
``chat_events.jsonl`` carries the most bytes into a scratch
``CHARLIEBOT_HOME`` under /tmp (metadata.json and data/ only; live home read
once for the copy, never written), warms the metadata cache as the live
server's polls do, and times 8-page backwards scrolls of 200 events over the
live half — one cold pass, as at first scroll after a server start with an
empty memo, then five timed repeats. Evidence while the live server runs older

M31 — worker-finalize events-summary read, steady state. Every worker completion
runs `read_events_summary` on the finalize path (and again on the
reviewer-completion path for the original worker's log), quoting the log's last
parseable events into the worker_summary bubble. The pre-fix reader full-parsed
the whole events.jsonl (~41 ms measured on the 6.7 MB worst on-disk log) and
sliced the last 80; the fixed reader walks 512 KiB segments from the end
collecting the last 80 parseable events — identical output, blank and malformed
lines never counting toward the budget in either form. The cost is thread-pool
time invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector times the function the finalize
path awaits over the largest on-disk worker log (read-only), from the checkout
under test: one cold pass, as at first finalize after a server start, then five
timed calls. Evidence while the live server runs older code points the same
collector at the branch checkout (`sys.path.insert` at the worktree root), the
same shape as the M7 protocol. The sibling review-context scan (the reviewer
prompt's delegation lookup over the session chat log) moved from a full parse
to stream-until-first-match in the same change; its position-dependent numbers
ride along in the PR's Evidence section instead of carrying a standing row.

M32 — memory-store assemble, steady state. The master run builds the
instruction block on every user message (``master_cc_run`` via
``_build_instructions_content``), and every worker spawn calls
``assemble_worker``; both full-parse the whole memory store (~68 entry files
plus the topics vocabulary) through ``load_store`` on every call. The cost is
to_thread time invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector times
``assemble_master`` over the live memory corpus (read-only), from the
checkout under test: one cold pass, as at a server start, then nine timed
calls. The fixed loader memoizes the parsed Store on a stat-only signature
((relative path, mtime_ns, size) of every parsed file): the steady state is
~69 stats and zero store bytes, and any rewrite, append, new entry, or
deletion re-parses. Only successful loads memoize — a malformed store keeps
raising on every call. Evidence while the live server runs older code points
the same collector at the branch checkout (``CHECKOUT`` at the worktree
root), the same shape as the M18 protocol:

```bash

M33 — assistant-stream draft render, full-turn replay. Every `stream` WebSocket
delta carries the whole accumulated draft, and the pre-fix `showStreaming`
(usage.js) painted it on every delta — `marked.parse(fixNestedFences(whole
draft))` plus a KaTeX re-walk and a bubble DOM swap — so a turn with N deltas
over an S-byte draft costs O(N × S) of main-thread markdown work, the chat UI's
jank source during long streamed turns; the fixed form coalesces paints to a
200 ms leading+trailing cadence, and `hideStreaming` cancels the pending paint
(every terminal path — committed bubble, error, session swap — hides first).
The cost is client-side, invisible to every HTTP probe, so the collector
(tests/stream_render_collector.js + the shared stream_render_harness.js) replays
a full turn in a node vm against the checkout's real usage.js/markdown-renderer.js
and the page-pinned marked build: the largest single assistant text block across
live chat files (a block cannot exceed its file's size, so smaller files skip),
fed as 200 B deltas at a 40 ms virtual cadence against a stub DOM/clock, one
cold pass then five timed replays wall-clocking only render work; KaTeX's
per-paint re-walk is stubbed identically in both arms, understating rather than
overstating the win (parity: the last frame equals a direct full-draft render).
Evidence points the collector at the branch checkout (`CHECKOUT` at the
worktree root, live state read-only), the same shape as the M18 protocol:

```bash
CHECKOUT=${CHECKOUT:-/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot} node /home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot/tests/stream_render_collector.js

M34 — worker-events poll fetch at the client's rendered count. The 5 s
workers-panel events poll served the whole projected history every round —
860706 B and 2177 events for the worst on-disk log; the projection itself
is memoized (M13), but serialization, transfer, and the client's full
innerHTML rebuild stayed O(history) per poll. The endpoint's ``after=N``
returns only the events past the client's rendered raw count (a sound
prefix cut: ``_append_worker_events`` never rewrites an emitted row) and
answers ``reset`` + the full payload when the count runs ahead; the client
appends tails through a scratch paint plus ``insertAdjacentHTML``. The
steady state (the metric) is a poll with nothing new. The collector copies
the worst on-disk worker log into a scratch ``CHARLIEBOT_HOME`` (live home
read once, never written), warms the memo, and times five full fetches (the
pre-fix behavior, a byte-identical code path) and five ``after=total``
fetches, asserting the empty-tail shape; the pytest suite pins prefix+tail
parity. Evidence points the same collector at the branch checkout

M35 — chat message-page responses (events/view/bootstrap), steady state. The chat
pagination endpoint (``GET /api/sessions/{id}/events``), the SPA-switch session view,
and the bootstrap payload return their message pages through FastAPI's default
response path, whose jsonable_encoder walk measures ~3x a plain json.dumps on the
211-message / 559 KB worst projection page (9 ms vs 3 ms) — the same gap the M34
envelope documented on mapped pydantic lists — while the memoized projection behind
the page serves O(page) (M26), so the encoder pass is the endpoint's dominant
server-side cost. The fixed handlers return a JSONResponse over the payload
directly; every field is already a plain parsed-JSON type or
``model_dump(mode="json")`` output, so the dumped body is byte-identical. The cost
is per page click / SPA switch, invisible to the standing HTTP probes, so the
collector snapshots the worst projection corpus (the session with the most live
chat events) into one shared scratch ``CHARLIEBOT_HOME`` (live home read once for
the copy, never written) and drives the three endpoints through TestClient in each
checkout's process: one cold pass per endpoint, as at first view after a server
start, then five timed requests, with digests read off the last timed response so
the view/bootstrap mark_read write-once cannot skew the cross-checkout comparison.
Evidence points the same collector at the before and after checkouts (``CHECKOUT``
at each root, shared ``M35_HOME`` snapshot), asserting byte-identical bodies, the
same shape as the M7 protocol. Snapshot once:

```bash
/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot/.venv/bin/python - <<'EOF'
import shutil, tempfile
from pathlib import Path

root = Path.home() / ".charliebot" / "sessions"
best, best_n = None, -1
for d in root.iterdir():
    p = d / "data" / "chat_events.jsonl"
    if p.is_file():
        with open(p, errors="replace") as f:
            n = sum(1 for _ in f)
        if n > best_n:
            best, best_n = d, n
home = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="m35-msg-page-home-", dir="/tmp"))
shutil.copytree(best, home / "sessions" / best.name)
print(f"export M35_HOME={home} M35_SID={best.name} M35_N={best_n}")

M36 — worker list poll payload and handler time, steady state. The 3 s
workers-panel poll (``GET /api/threads/{sid}/list``) serves an unchanged
session from the whole-body memo; a poll repeating the ETag it rendered via
``?etag=`` gets a bodyless 204 instead of the full rows, so the steady state
transfers zero body bytes and the client skips its JSON.parse. The conditional
rides a query param rather than If-None-Match because the browser's HTTP cache
fulfils a revalidation itself and fetch never surfaces the 304; no-store on
every answer keeps each poll a real request. The collector drives the endpoint
through TestClient over the session whose threads directory carries the most
metadata bytes (live state read-only), with the thread and trigger managers
built once as the server's dependency singletons are — per-request manager
instances would rebuild the M5/M24 memos on every call and drown the measured
path in a memo-cold scan the live server never pays. One cold pass, as at
first panel paint after a server start, then seven timed full requests
(first paint / changed rows; byte-identical code path before and after) and
seven timed conditional repeats. Evidence while the live server runs older
code points the same collector at the branch checkout (``CHECKOUT`` at the
worktree root), the same shape as the M7 protocol:

M37 — archived-session chat tail page, steady state. Sessions with
``archive_offset > 0`` serve the chat view and bootstrap from
``load_chat_events_tail`` → ``parse_ndjson_tail`` (unarchived sessions use the
M26 message projection), and the pre-fix reader paid a full-file line count
plus the 512 KiB tail-window parse on every SPA switch — repeat work against
an unchanged file. The fixed reader memoizes the whole page and,
independently, the line count on (mtime_ns, size): a repeat over an
unchanged file pays one stat and zero file bytes; an append re-reads the
count and window. Each signature is taken before its read, so an entry
recorded during a concurrent append keys the older signature and can never
be served for the newer bytes (chat files only append; archive rewrites
replace the whole file). The line-count memo is shared with
``count_ndjson_lines``, the ``get_chat_event_count_sync`` path behind the
recap default divider. The cost is a per-view latency no standing HTTP
probe isolates (the biggest live files belong to unarchived sessions, which
route through the projection — the heaviest tail-page corpus on disk is the
7.4 MB archived-session live file), so the collector times the function the
view awaits over the worst on-disk archived live file (read-only), from the
checkout under test: one cold pass, as at first view of the session, then
nine timed repeats, asserting the served page is repeat-call identical.
Evidence while the live server runs older code points the same collector at
the branch checkout (``CHECKOUT`` at the worktree root), the same shape as
the M18 protocol:

M38 — session stream-broadcast fan-out, worst on-disk turn replay. Every stream part
feeds ``persist_and_broadcast``, whose aggregator emits a ``stream`` preview carrying the
whole accumulated draft; the pre-fix fan-out serialized that draft per delta per
subscriber (O(deltas × draft) of event-loop json.dumps: 78 ms / 174 frames on the worst
on-disk turn), and the fixed StreamingManager coalesces previews per channel (leading +
200 ms trailing windows at the client's showStreaming paint cadence, pending dropped only
on the preview-hiding types) and serializes once per fan-out. The collector resolves the
worst stream turn on disk (events between bare user events whose stream deltas carry the
most preview bytes; only files ≥ 2 MB contend), replays it instant-feed through the real
``MessageAggregator`` and ``StreamingManager`` into a stub socket mirroring starlette's
send_json (json.dumps wrapped process-wide so both arms count), stopping before
``master_done`` so both arms must deliver the final preview. Evidence points the

M39 — tui/status busy check, steady state. The 3 s tui-status poll
(`fetchTuiStatus`, per visible tab) runs `_claude_jsonl_busy` per running tui
session, whose pre-fix form globbed all of `~/.claude/projects` inline on the
event loop on every call — ~15 ms of loop stall per check at this host's
942-dir projects corpus, delaying every concurrent request and WebSocket. The
fixed form memoizes the transcript path per session id (a hit is stable for
the session's life; a miss re-globs at a 30 s TTL) and awaits the check in a
thread. The collector drives the endpoint's fixed call shape
(`asyncio.to_thread` of `_claude_jsonl_busy`) with a concurrent 5 ms ticker
over a synthetic never-present session id — the glob cost is corpus-shaped,
identical for a real hit — from the checkout under test: one cold pass, as at
a server start with an empty memo, then nine timed steady-state checks (all
inside the miss TTL, so a glob would fire on every call were the memo absent).
The pre-fix number is the same command with `_claude_jsonl_busy(SID)` called
inline (the endpoint's pre-fix call shape) against an unmemoized import.

M40 — session-list filtered listing and group-name reduction, steady state. The
sessions page's load fetches hit `GET /api/sessions/starred` and
`GET /api/sessions/groups`; the pre-fix `list_sessions` copied and
thinking-stamped every cached meta (~1012 rows at measurement) before the
starred/scheduled filters ran (the starred list keeps ~10), and the groups
handler plus the autonamer's group list paid the same full copy pass to reduce
the corpus to ~25 names — several ms of on-loop pydantic work per request.
The fixed `list_sessions` runs the starred/scheduled filters against the shared
cached metas (read-only) so only surviving rows pay the model_copy and thinking
stamp, and the group-name readers go through `list_group_names`, a read-only
reduction of the cached metas with no copies at all. The per-request enrich and
enrichment-free paths behind the standing status poll are unchanged. The cost
is a page-load latency no standing row covers, so the collector times the two
handler-level manager calls over the live session corpus (read-only), from the
checkout under test: one cold pass, as at a server start with an empty metadata
cache, then nine timed pairs. The pre-fix numbers used in the landing PR's
evidence are the same verbatim command with the pre-fix groups handler body
(`sorted({s.group for s in await mgr.list_sessions() if s.group})`) in place of
the `list_group_names()` call, the same shape as the M21 protocol. Evidence

M41 — git diff/files repeat view, steady state. The /diff viewer fetches
``GET /api/git/diff/files`` on every page open and on every refresh of a review
loop's pinned /diff link; each fetch ran one ``rev-parse`` and two sequential
``git diff`` subprocesses over the range (~0.18 s on the root..HEAD worst
corpus) to recompute an immutable result: a diff between two commits never
changes (SHAs are content-addressed). The fixed handler resolves both refs
through a ref-resolution memo keyed on a stat-only ref-state signature (the
git dir's top-level pseudo-refs, packed-refs, and the loose refs tree — the
full ``rev-parse`` read set), runs the two manifest diffs concurrently on a
miss, and serves a repeat view of the same (repo, base_sha, head_sha, mode,
.gitattributes signature) from the manifest memo with zero subprocesses — the
attributes signature keys git's worktree diff drivers, which feed
``--numstat``'s counts. The cost is per page view, invisible to the standing
HTTP probes, so the collector drives ``diff_files`` over the charlie-bot
checkout's full history (root commit .. HEAD — the largest range this host's
workspace carries; read-only, with a scratch ``CHARLIEBOT_HOME``), from the
checkout under test: the first view, as at page open with a cold memo, then

M42 — scheduler tick session scan, steady state. Every 60 s scheduler tick rebuilds the
per-task session cache from the session corpus; the pre-fix form copied and thinking-stamped
every cached meta (~1012 rows of on-loop pydantic work at measurement) only to read each
row's `scheduled_task` field, while the fixed form passes the M40 `scheduled=True` pre-copy
filter and copies just the surviving rows. The tick is background work invisible to HTTP
probes, so the collector drives `Scheduler._tick` over the live config and session
corpora with a concurrent 5 ms ticker, from the checkout under test: one cold pass, as at

M43 — git diff/file repeat expand, steady state. The /diff viewer fetches
``GET /api/git/diff/file`` on every file expand, and a collapse drops the
rendered body, so every re-expand, second tab, or refresh re-runs one
``git diff`` subprocess over the range (~44 ms on the heaviest file of the
charlie-bot root..HEAD manifest) to recompute an immutable result: a per-file
diff between two commits never changes (SHAs are content-addressed). The fixed
handler memoizes the body on the M41 manifest key plus the pathspec — repo,
resolved base/head SHAs, mode, .gitattributes signature (diff drivers feed the
emitted hunks), (old_path, path) — and builds the miss path's range spec from
the resolved SHAs, so a ref moving mid-request can never key one pair's body
under another; a repeat pays zero subprocesses — the M41 ref-state signature
proves the resolution current and the body memo serves the bytes. The cost is
per file expand, invisible to the standing HTTP probes, so the collector drives
``diff_file`` over the heaviest file of the charlie-bot checkout's root..HEAD
manifest (read-only, scratch ``CHARLIEBOT_HOME``), from the checkout under

M44 — scheduled-list next-run resolution, steady state. Every grouped sidebar
render pairs ``GET /api/sessions/scheduled`` with ``GET /api/cron/tasks`` (the
project-manager refresh fires on every list render), and the handler resolved
each scheduled row's next fire with one ``croniter(...).get_next`` expand per
row per request (~248 µs each measured, ~3 ms at the 12-task live corpus) — a
pure function of (cron, timezone, now) whose answer stays valid until the fire
time it names, so every repeat request inside that window recomputed an
identical string. The fixed handler serves rows from a memo keyed on (cron,
timezone), entries valid until their named fire time passes; a fire that went
by recomputes on the next request. The cost is a sidebar-render latency
invisible to the standing HTTP probes, so the collector drives the endpoint
through TestClient over the live session + cron corpora (read-only), with
managers built once as the server's dependency singletons are (per-request
instances would rebuild the M5/M24 memos on every call, drowning the measured

M45 — session-WS catchup replay event-loop lag, stale-cursor reconnect. When a session
WebSocket (re)connects behind the live event count (a mid-turn reconnect after a network
flap), `_send_session_catchup` replays the events past the cursor through
`_replay_aggregated_catchup`, which must feed the FULL event list to rebuild aggregator
state (a run interval that opened before the cursor drives the deltas after it). The
pre-fix form ran that feed loop inline on the event loop — 22 ms measured 2026-09-04
on the 20534-event worst live corpus — freezing every concurrent request and WebSocket
for the walk's wall time; the 2026-09-04 form moved it to a whole-corpus thread run,
which traded the inline freeze for loop-lag behind GIL handoffs (10.2 ms measured
2026-09-05); the fixed form feeds the same walk in ~1 ms on-loop slices through
`_CatchupWalk` and sends pre-rendered wire text in order, so no slice holds the loop
past the poll cadences' resolution (identical frame list and wire bytes, identical
stop-at-first-failure count).
The cursor==total fast-skip never enters the replay, which the past day's 85 live
`session_ws_catchup_sent` log lines confirm (all sent=0), so this is a cold-path
insurance metric, invisible to the standing probes; the collector resolves the session
whose live chat file carries the most events, copies only that session into a scratch
`CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp (metadata.json and data/ only; live home read once for
the copy, never written), warms the events cache as the server's to_thread load does,
and replays at cursor = total − 50 (a reconnect 50 events behind) through a stub
socket with a concurrent 5 ms ticker, reporting the replay's worst ticker gap plus
wall — one cold pass, as at the first stale-cursor reconnect after a server start,
then five timed replays, with a frame-list digest pinning cross-checkout parity.

M46 — cron tasks list payload and handler time, steady state. Every grouped
sidebar render pairs ``GET /api/cron/tasks`` with ``GET /api/sessions/scheduled``
(the project-manager refresh fires on every list render), and the pre-fix route
shipped every task's resolved prompt body — ~90 KB of the 96 KB live response,
content only the in-process scheduler/master reads (the UI edits
``prompt_file``) — plus the client pays a same-size JSON.parse per render. The
fixed dump excludes ``prompt``, mirroring the POST/PUT responses which never
carried it. The cost rides the sidebar render path, so the collector drives the
endpoint through TestClient over the live cron corpus (read-only:
``get_scheduled_tasks`` serves the fingerprint-cached snapshot; nothing is
written), one cold pass, as at first sidebar render after a server start, then
nine timed requests, re-running rather than comparing noise when the live
config drifts mid-measurement. Evidence while the live server runs older code

M47 — claude declared-window warning stream, steady state. Every claude-session
usage resolution re-derives the headless declared window from the environment
(`_resolve_claude_tier` → `headless_claude_declared_window`), and while a
forwarded-but-unmodelled override is exported (this host sets
`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=400000`) each resolution re-fires the same
degradation warning — 62 lines in the 7.89 h live server log sampled 2026-09-04
(~8/h) — while one sighting per process carries the whole signal: the
environment the warning reports cannot change between resolutions. The cost is
background log volume invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector drives the
resolution directly with the override exported: one first-sighting call, as at
a process start, then 60 steady-state repeat calls, counting the event. A
warning in the repeat window is a re-fired alarm; the count is the metric.
Evidence while the live server runs older code points the same collector at the

M22 protocol:

M48 — search content-scan missing-file debug stream, steady state. Every
sidebar search (`GET /api/sessions/search?q=…`) content-scans the active
sessions whose names miss the query, and the scan's stat of a session whose
live chat file cannot be read (a fresh session's data/ stays empty until its
first event lands) logs `search_read_failed` on every request — 30 lines in
the 11.92 h live server log sampled 2026-09-04, all naming the one such
session — while one sighting per (session, error) carries the whole signal:
a repeat round that sees the same failure re-fires a fired alarm. The cost
is background log volume invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector creates
one fresh session in a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` and drives `search_sessions`
with an absent needle: one first-sighting scan, as at a process start, then
60 steady-state repeat scans, counting the event. A line in the repeat
window is a re-fired alarm; the count is the metric. Evidence while the live

M49 — opencode part-unhandled debug stream, steady state. Every opencode SSE
`message.part.updated` frame routes through `_translate_part`, and a part type
the translator does not map logs `opencode_part_unhandled` per part — 152 lines
in the 12.88 h live server log sampled 2026-09-04 (~12/h), every one of them
`type=patch`, so a stream of unhandled parts re-fires the same line forever
while one sighting per part type carries the whole signal: the set of mapped
types is code, fixed for the process. The cost is background log volume
invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector drives `_translate_part` on a
synthetic unhandled part: one first-sighting call, as at a process start, then
60 steady-state repeat calls, counting the event. A line in the repeat window
is a re-fired alarm; the count is the metric. Evidence while the live server

```

M50 — ext-usage credentials read warning stream, steady state. Every
claude-account poll round re-reads the account's credentials file
(`ClaudeUsageProvider.fetch` → `_read_credentials`), and while the file is
missing or carries no access token each round re-fires the same warning —
135 lines in the 13.89 h live server log sampled 2026-09-04 (~10/h), every
one of them `ext_usage_no_access_token` naming the same path — while one
sighting per (event, path) per broken streak carries the whole signal: the
file is re-read every round, so a recovery (a read that returns a token)
re-arms the path and a later relapse is a new onset, earning one new line.
The cost is background log volume invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector
drives `_read_credentials` over a synthetic tokenless credentials file: one
first-sighting read, as at a process start, then 60 steady-state repeat

M51 — sidebar dirty-session deep probe, post-write. The 3 s status poll deep-probes a
session whenever its stat-only probe-input signature moved — which is every poll that
follows any write to the session (session/thread metadata writes mark it dirty), i.e.
continuously during an active turn. The deep probe's read path re-enters
`iter_recent_thread_metas`, which read and re-parsed every in-window (30-day) thread
metadata file per probe. The collector copies the session whose threads dir carries the
most metadata files (the M5 resolution rule) into a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp
(live home read once for the copy, never written), warms the probe as a server start
does, then drives the post-write poll's shape: one atomic metadata rewrite (the
tmp-file rename every thread-metadata writer performs) dirties the signature, and the
sweep that follows is the deep probe — one cold pass, then five timed post-write sweeps,
victim rotation resolved once so the pick itself stays out of the timing. Evidence while

M52 — chat-event append, per event. Every streamed turn appends one chat event per
delta through `save_chat_event` (`persist_and_broadcast` awaits it before each
broadcast), and every worker event lands through the same `append_ndjson` funnel;
the append is O(1) disk work but its per-call overhead rides the delta path. The
cost is write-side thread-pool time invisible to the read-side standing rows, so
the collector copies the session whose live chat file carries the most events into
a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp (metadata.json and data/ only; live home
read once for the copy, never written), warms the events cache as a live streamed
turn does, and times 50 `save_chat_event` appends of one probe event, asserting
the appended lines parse back from disk in order. Evidence while the live server

M53 — config reload failure re-fire, broken steady state. `get_config` is the
per-request config read (the auth middleware calls it on every HTTP request,
the scheduler on every tick), and while the corpus stays broken a failed
reload re-ran the full YAML parse + model validation and re-fired
`config_reload_failed` on every call — the pre-fix form left `_config_mtime`
at the old fingerprint, so the reload condition never went false (the live
burst: 4431 lines in a 24.9 h server log, ~1/s inside the 16:00-18:00 window
of 2026-09-04, three distinct error strings). The fixed form memoizes the
failed reload on its fingerprint — re-parse only when a file moves, the same
freshness rule the success path follows — and routes the warning through a
warn-once registry, one line per error string per process, cleared on a
successful load so a relapse earns one new line. The cost is per-request work
invisible to the standing probes while the corpus is broken (a state the live
host entered for a 2 h window), so the collector seeds a good config in a
scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME`, breaks it with a key the model does not declare
(the burst's error shape), and drives `get_config`:
one onset pass, as at the first call after the corpus breaks, then 60 timed
steady-state calls asserting the served instance's identity, then one
fingerprint-move round asserting the freshness survived. Evidence points the
same collector at the before and after checkouts (`CHECKOUT` at each root),
the same shape as the M18 protocol:

M54 — stream-draft paint work with the page's real highlight.js build. The
M33 harness stubs hljs, so the standing replay metric never sees
highlightAuto's cost: with the served 11.9.0 common build (36 languages),
highlightAuto scores the block against every language (~0.26 s per 24 KB
measured), and every streaming paint re-parses the whole draft, re-running it
on every unchanged code block in the draft. The collector loads the pinned
hljs build into the same harness and replays the largest on-disk assistant
draft containing a bare code fence — the corpus shape whose paint cost
highlightAuto dominates. Evidence points the collector at the before and
after checkouts (`CHECKOUT` at each root, live state read-only), the same
shape as the M18 protocol:

```bash
CHECKOUT=${CHECKOUT:-/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot} node /home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot/tests/stream_hl_render_collector.js
```

M55 — artifact compare-view serve, steady state. The plan panel's Compare with previous
toggle and every artifact `?diff=` link run the file server's annotate path:
the pre-fix handler read both pages and ran `plan_diff.annotate` inline on the
event loop per request — ~0.25 s of loop freeze per compare view of a 1 MB
pair (the M14 pathology), re-computing an immutable result on every repeat
view (the toggle flip, a plan update re-render, a refresh). The fixed handler
builds the page in one thread hop and memoizes it on both files' (path,
mtime_ns, size) signatures plus the injection flag — the marks are a pure
function of the two files' bytes and artifact pages are only ever written
whole, so a repeat view re-runs zero annotate. The cost is a per-click latency
no standing probe covers, so the collector snapshots the worst artifact pair
(the session whose artifacts dir carries the most .html bytes; target =
biggest page, base = runner-up) into a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp
(live home read once for the copy, never written) and drives the route through
TestClient in each checkout's process: one cold pass, as at first compare-view
open, then nine timed repeats, asserting byte-identical bodies. The cold pass
is the first-view sub-metric (the annotate the repeat memo serves from); the
nine timed repeats are the steady state. Evidence
points the same collector at the before and after checkouts (``CHECKOUT`` at
each root, shared snapshot home), the same shape as the M35 protocol.
Snapshot once:

```bash

M56 — sidebar status poll, steady state. The sidebar polls `GET /api/sessions/status?ids=…` every
3 s per open dashboard tab with the sessions it renders (this host's second-busiest route after
the workers-panel list); the handler resolves every id's metadata plus the derived sidebar state
and the pre-fix mapped return paid FastAPI's jsonable_encoder pass over the 41-row dict. The cost
is per-poll latency invisible to the standing HTTP probes (M3 reads the 401 floor), so the
collector drives the endpoint through TestClient over the live corpus (read-only), ids resolved
from the active-session listing, from the checkout under test: one cold pass, as at first
sidebar paint after a server start, then nine timed requests, with a parsed-body digest so a
corpus change between arms cannot masquerade as a payload difference.

M58 — per-request config read, steady state. `get_config` is the per-request config read (the
auth middleware calls it on every HTTP request, the scheduler on every tick), and its reload
check re-derives the config fingerprint on every call — after M53 the steady state is one
fingerprint walk per call, so that walk is the per-request floor's dominant slice (the raw-ASGI
401 path measured ~150 µs total, ~130 µs of it the pre-fix fingerprint's pathlib machinery).
The cost is per-request latency the HTTP standing probes only see mixed into their totals, so
the collector times `get_config` itself over the live config corpus (read-only: a fresh stat
set per call, never a write), from the checkout under test: one cold pass, as at a server
start, then nine timed calls. The healthy range bounds the fresh-stat walk; a jump toward the
parse-sized costs (the M53 broken-corpus wall) means a fingerprint miss is landing per call.

M59 — worker thread-detail poll payload and handler time, steady state. The workers panel polls
`GET /api/threads/{sid}/threads/{tid}` every 5 s per expanded running worker (in the same
`Promise.all` as the M34 events poll) and the pre-fix route served the whole row — description-KB
payload, an uncached aiofiles read+parse per call, and FastAPI's response-model validation plus
jsonable_encoder render — for the client to read two derived fields (`attach_command`,
`attach_available`); the full row remains the description modal's once-per-click fetch. The cost
is a poll slice invisible to the standing HTTP probes, so the collector drives the endpoint
through TestClient over the thread whose metadata.json carries the most bytes (live state
read-only), from the checkout under test: one cold pass per mode, as at first panel expand after
a server start, then nine timed requests of the full row and nine of the attach-mode pair, with
the payload contracts asserted. Evidence while the live server runs older code points the same

M60 — chat message-body markdown parse, repeat page render. Every session switch
rebuilds the turn engine, so the same page's message bodies re-run the parse
(marked + fence fix) on every re-entry and every repeat render; the streaming
draft paint keeps its own path (M33/M54). The collector loads the checkout's
markdown-renderer.js with the page's real marked + highlight.js builds, resolves
the worst page corpus (the 40 largest message bodies of the live chat file
carrying the most bytes; live state read-only), and times full page passes — one
cold pass, as at the first render after a page load, then five timed repeats.
The pre-fix form (no `renderProseMarkdown`) re-parses every repeat; the
post-fix form serves them from the memo; both forms are the same command, the
checkout under test decides. The cold first paint reports two slices since the
deferral PR: the deferred parse (the bytes the user sees on first paint, code
blocks escaped-plain) and the highlight flush (the same hljs work carried by the
scheduled flush that swaps settled bytes into the DOM and settles the memo
entries), so the first-paint cost and the deferred work stay visible
separately. Evidence points the same collector at the before
and after checkouts (`CHECKOUT` at each root), the same shape as the M18
protocol:

```bash
CHECKOUT=${CHECKOUT:-/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot} node /home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot/tests/message_render_collector.js
```

M61 — session-metadata read after TTL expiry, idle-cold. Every dashboard listing (`GET /api/sessions`,
`/starred`, `/archived`, `/scheduled`, search) and every single-session read routes through the
metadata cache, whose entries expire after `_METADATA_CACHE_TTL` (30 s) — the state any of those
requests hits when no tab has polled for 30 s. Archived entries never expire (served regardless of
age), so the idle cost is the non-archived set's revalidation: the pre-fix form re-read and re-parsed
each expired active metadata.json (three aiofiles executor hops per single read, one batched
read+parse per listing), while the fixed form revalidates the entry with one stat against the
(st_mtime_ns, st_size) its read took before parsing — every writer publishes through the atomic tmp
rename, so unchanged bytes always match and only a moved file re-reads. The cost is a per-request
latency no standing probe isolates (the polls keep their own sessions fresh), so the collector warms
every entry as the live server's polls do, then rewinds each entry's timestamp past the TTL before
every timed call (preserving the entry's signature half, whatever the checkout's tuple shape) —
replaying the idle window without waiting it, read-only over the live home. One cold pass, as at the
first read after the idle window, then five timed calls per scenario. Evidence points the same
collector at the before and after checkouts (`CHECKOUT` at each root), the same shape as the M18

M62 — spawn base-resolution chain, base-less launch. An unattended launch resolves its
worktree base from the remote itself: the default branch (HEAD symref) plus that branch's
published tip, then the start point. The pre-fix chain asked the remote three times in
series — a filtered symref ls-remote, a second filtered ls-remote for the same branch, and
an unconditional fetch — while one unfiltered listing answers both probes and the probe's
own tip SHA proves the fetch a no-op whenever the remote-tracking ref is current. The cost
sits on every worker spawn's pre-process latency (delegations, improve-loop iterations,
cron launches), invisible to the standing HTTP probes, so the collector drives the
resolution chain over the real workspace repo (read-only git ops; resolve fetches only
when its probe shows the tracking ref behind), from the checkout under test: one warm
pass, as at the first spawn after a server start, then five timed rounds, asserting the
start point is round-stable. Evidence while the live server runs older code points the
same collector at the branch checkout (`CHECKOUT` at the worktree root), the same shape as
the M18 protocol:

M63 — session view thread payload, worst on-disk threads corpus. Every SPA switch and
session open fetches `GET /api/sessions/{id}/view`, whose `threads` array rode as whole
`ThreadMetadata` dumps — task-spec-length descriptions included, ~7.8 KB per row at the
worst corpus — while the workers tab it feeds paints one CSS-truncated description line
per card and its full-text modal fetches the thread row on click (the M36 list contract,
which the same card builder already consumes). The fix ships the M36 prefixed rows, so
the view body carries one prefix per thread instead of the whole metadata. The handler's
mark_read write rules out driving the live instance, so the collector resolves the session
whose threads directory carries the most metadata files (the M5 resolution rule), copies
that session (metadata.json, data/, threads/) into a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp
(live home read once for the copy, never written), and times the handler function from the
checkout under test: one cold pass, as at first view after a server start, then nine timed
calls. The TestClient-level request cost rides the same harness floor on both arms and
travels in the PR's Evidence section, not in this row.

M65 — big-page gzip event-loop stall, whole-body JSON response. The app mounts
`_CharlieBotGZipMiddleware` (level 1, bodies ≥ 1 KB), and Starlette's GZipResponder runs a
whole-body response's entire deflate inside the send path — so every JSON page the browser
fetches with `Accept-Encoding: gzip` freezes the event loop for the full compression while
it also renders, an invisible sibling of the M14/M55 stalls. The collector drives the real
app stack (gzip + auth middleware) raw-ASGI, with a concurrent 5 ms ticker, against a scratch
`CHARLIEBOT_HOME` (its config carries an empty access key, which the auth middleware passes
through) holding a copy of the worst on-disk live events corpus (metadata.json and data/,
live home read once for the copy, never written), fetching the 200-message events page with
gzip accepted: one cold pass, as at the first big page after a server start, then nine timed
runs reporting the worst ticker gap and wall each. Streaming bodies (SSE) keep the inline
per-chunk path and are out of this metric's shape.

M66 — perfetto merged-trace build wall, steady state. The first view of a merged trace awaits
`merge_traces` in the server's process pool — a full `json.load` of every input plus a per-event
re-serialize into the gzip stream — so the build wall is user-visible first-view latency (the
cache answers repeat views). The cost is background pool work invisible to HTTP probes, so the
collector times the build over the largest Chrome-JSON trace on disk (read-only; scratch output
under /tmp), from the checkout under test: one cold pass, as at the first view of a corpus, then
three timed builds. The trace roots are the host's documented trace homes (~/data, ~/scripts);
no qualifying file prints nothing and the round treats the metric as unmeasured. Evidence while
the live server runs older code points the same collector at the branch checkout (`CHECKOUT` at
the worktree root), the same shape as the M18 protocol:

M67 — sidebar deep-probe trigger scan, steady state. The status poll's dirty-session deep probe
(the M51 shape: every poll that follows any write to the session) runs `pending_trigger_state_sync`,
whose pre-fix form read and parsed every trigger `*.json` of the session on every call while its two
sibling probe reads (thread metadata via the M51 memo, plans via the M27 memo) were already
memoized. The cost is background probe work invisible to the standing HTTP probes, so the collector
times the function over the session whose triggers directory carries the most files (read-only over
the live state), from the checkout under test: one cold pass, as at a server start with an empty
memo, then nine timed calls. The fixed reader memoizes each trigger file's parsed dict on
(mtime_ns, size): the steady state is one scandir and one stat per file and zero corpus bytes, and a
`_save_trigger` rewrite (schedule/cancel/fire) re-reads only that file. Trigger files change only
through that atomic rewrite, so the key is sound. Evidence while the live server runs older code

M68 — worker-list marked changed-poll rebuild. During an active turn the running
worker's metadata.json rewrites continuously, so nearly every 3 s poll of that
session's workers panel takes the list body's rebuild path instead of the M36
memo hit. The rebuild's shape is one writer mark plus one poll; the collector
copies the session whose threads directory carries the most metadata bytes into
a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp (live home read once for the copy, never
written), wires the copy through the config dependency the endpoint resolves
(`get_config_on_loop` — overriding `get_config` alone leaves the endpoint on
the live home, where the scratch rewrites are invisible and no rebuild ever
happens; the pre-repair collector measured walk-plus-memo-serve, the vacuous
class), and drives the marked shape: one cold build, one memo-hit poll, then
eight rounds of (one atomic metadata rewrite + the writer funnel's
`mark_sidebar_dirty` with the published path, one timed request) — every timed
request a genuine rebuild, answered by the incremental proof the writers'
path-carrying marks enable. The unchanged-poll steady state has no row here;
M36 owns it.

M69 — opencode SSE unhandled-event debug stream, steady state. Every `opencode serve`
SSE frame routes through `_translate_sse_event`, and an event type the translator
neither maps nor ignores logs `opencode_sse_event_unhandled` per frame — 306 lines
in the 68.85 h live server log sampled 2026-09-06, 295 of them `type=todo.updated`
(one per todo write) and 11 `type=session.compacted` — so a stream of unhandled
frames re-fires the same line forever while one sighting per event type carries
the whole signal: the set of handled types is code, fixed for the process. The
cost is background log volume invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector drives
`_translate_sse_event` on a synthetic unhandled frame: one first-sighting call,
as at a process start, then 60 steady-state repeat calls, counting the event. A
line in the repeat window is a re-fired alarm; the count is the metric. Evidence

while the `?diff=` sibling served repeats from the M55 annotate memo. The chat log links plan and
report pages that are re-opened repeatedly (794 of the 823 artifact views in the 69.85 h live log
sampled 2026-09-06 were repeats of an already-viewed file), so each repeat paid the full-file read
(~4.8 ms on the 1.08 MB worst artifact) plus the injection for identical bytes. The collector
copies the largest on-disk artifact page into a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp (live home
read once for the copy, never written) and drives the files router through TestClient in each
checkout's process: one cold pass, as at first artifact view, then nine timed requests, with the
snapshot's empty access key credentialing every reader (the injection gate reads the process
home's credentials, so the run points ``CHARLIEBOT_HOME`` at the snapshot). Snapshot once:

```bash
/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot/.venv/bin/python - <<'EOF'
import shutil, tempfile
from pathlib import Path

# Worst clean-view corpus: the largest .html artifact page on disk; the
# credentialed view reads and re-injects the whole page per request.

M71 — sidebar search capped name-match response, steady state. The search box's
short queries are the route's worst shape: a one-character query matches
hundreds of archived names, and the pre-fix manager copied and sidebar-populated
every match before the 200-row cap applied at the end. The cost is a per-
keystroke latency invisible to the standing probes (M8 reads the absent-needle
shape, whose result rows are zero), so the collector snapshots the search corpus
(every session's metadata.json, the active sessions' live chat files, and every
session's triggers/ — the derived trigger fields ride the response) into a
scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp (live home read once for the copy, never
written), resolves the single character matching the most session names, and
drives the route through TestClient in each checkout's process: one cold pass,
as at the first capped search after a server start, then nine timed requests,
with a parsed-body digest so a corpus difference between arms cannot masquerade
as a payload difference. Evidence points the same collector at the before and

M72 — file-browser directory listing. The file server renders a directory's
listing per request (`GET /files/<dir>` and `HEAD`); the browser's navigation
clicks pay the walk. The page memoizes on the walk's own entry snapshot
(per-entry (is_dir, name, size, mtime), the resolved dir and URL prefix around
it): equal walked state proves the stored page equals what this walk would
build, so a repeat view pays the walk plus one lookup, and a corpus move since
the stored page keyed — a metadata rename into a session dir moves exactly that
dir's mtime — keys the miss to a rebuild. The rebuild renders each row through
the row memo keyed on the same entry tuple plus the prefix; unchanged rows
serve as strings and only the moved entries re-render. The cost is a
navigation click, invisible to the standing HTTP probes (the chat log's
file-server traffic is artifact pages, the M70 shape; directory listings are
rare — 16 in the 78.85 h live log sampled 2026-09-07), so the collector drives
the files router through TestClient over the sessions root — the file browser's
own starting directory and the largest entry count the UI navigates on this
host, read-only — from the checkout under test: one cold pass, as at the first
browser open, then nine timed requests, with the served-body sha1 so a corpus
difference between arms cannot masquerade as a payload difference.

M72 changed-round — the rebuild behind a view whose corpus moved since the stored page keyed (the
navigation shape between two browser opens with any session write between them; the standing
collector's back-to-back requests never cross a move — 0 rebuilds across 27 timed requests at the
2026-09-12 corpus). The harness drops the page memo per timed round instead of writing the live
corpus — the key miss the move produces — and leaves the row memo warm, as the long-running
server's is; the walk, sort, and join re-run per round and unchanged rows serve as strings:

M73 — plan-verb validation event-loop lag. Every plan present/amend runs
`_validate_new_version_file`, whose registration gate is the full plan assertion set
(`run_assertions`): the DOM checks plus the page-height measurement, which renders the page
through a headless-Chrome subprocess — hundreds of ms of wall time per page. The pre-fix
form ran that inline in the async verb, so every plan delivery froze the event loop for the
full Chrome render — the M14 pathology on the plan-delivery path (the live server log shows
the freeze as POST /api/internal/plan/amend and /plan/present request times of ~0.6-0.7 s).
The fixed form hops the assertion run to a thread; the loop-lag is the metric (the wall is
the Chrome render's own cost, now off-loop, and only bounds health). The cost is per
plan-delivery latency invisible to the standing HTTP probes (the verbs fire when the master
agent delivers or amends a plan, not on any poll), so the collector copies the smallest plan
page bound in a live plans.json that still passes the current pure assertion set (read-only
resolution; the page-height half runs through the host's real headless renderer, so the
corpus must be one that passes it) into a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp, drives
`PlanRegistryManager` from the checkout under test — one cold present, as at the first plan
delivery after a server start, then five timed amends, each validating a fresh unbound copy,
with a concurrent 5 ms ticker reporting the worst gap plus wall:

M74 — master turn-end raw-log rescan. Every claude-family master turn ends with
the model-attribution rescan: a whole read+parse+project of the turn's own raw
log through a fresh backend translate, tens of ms on a multi-MB turn — inline
on the event loop before the fix, freezing every concurrent request and
WebSocket at the exact moment the client renders the turn's result (the M14
pathology on the turn-end path); the fixed site hops to a thread, which trades
the inline freeze for the GIL-handoff surcharge the M45 history documented
(~11 ms worst-corpus vs the 5 ms ticker floor on this host). The cost is a
per-turn freeze invisible to the standing HTTP probes, so the collector
resolves the largest on-disk master-run raw log under the live sessions dir
(read-only), builds the scan's translate from the config's first cc-claude
option — the corpus is claude-shaped and the worst log's session backend id no
longer resolves in the config, while the live path's fallback for an
unresolvable option degrades to the identity translate — and drives the scan
through the production call shape with a concurrent 5 ms ticker, from the
checkout under test: one cold pass, as at a first turn end, then five timed
scans. The pre-fix numbers in the landing row are the same scan inline (the
pre-fix call shape, `runs.project_raw_events(runs.parse_raw_lines(...))`
without the hop). Evidence while the live server runs older code points the
same collector at the branch checkout (``CHECKOUT`` at the worktree root), the

M75 — live-aggregator catch-up, first streamed event. The first
`persist_and_broadcast` for a session after server start caught the live
aggregator up to the whole on-disk live corpus — one whole parse plus one
feed of every persisted event, with a per-event draft-snapshot build whose
delta the catch-up discards — inline on the event loop before the fix,
freezing every concurrent request and WebSocket at the session's first
persisted event after every server restart (the M14 pathology on the

per-session init lock, which trades the inline freeze for the GIL-handoff
surcharge the M45/M74 history documented (~11 ms worst-corpus vs the 5 ms

construct with ``emit_stream_deltas=False`` so the discarded snapshots are
never built. The cost is a per-session freeze invisible to the standing HTTP
probes, so the collector copies the session whose live chat file carries the
most events (live home read-only) into a scratch ``CHARLIEBOT_HOME`` under
/tmp — each timed round builds its own scratch home and copies the corpus
before the timed region — and drives the init through the production call
shape with a concurrent 5 ms ticker, from the checkout under test: one cold
pass, as at a server start, then five timed inits, each on a fresh manager
and corpus copy (the call shape differs across the fix — sync inline before,
awaited after — so the collector dispatches on ``iscoroutinefunction``).
The post-fix hop's GIL-handoff floor measured 0.0108-0.0157 s across rounds
(above M74's 0.015 s pin — the catch-up's parse+feed holds the GIL longer
than M74's scan), so this PR calibrates the range at < 0.020 s. Evidence

M76 — finalize-judgment reads, warm chain. Every worker and reviewer completion runs the
finalize chain's two idempotency judgments over the delegating session's whole chat history —
the duplicate-summary check (`terminal_summary_present` behind `_persist_worker_summary_once`)
and the wake judgment (`master_woke_after_summary` behind `_trigger_master_judged`) — and the
pre-fix forms ran both scans plus the event-list load inline on the event loop. The fixed form
serves both answers from the chat-event store's per-session finalize fold in O(1) (glossary on
`_FinalizeFold`; rules imported from finalize_effects' own predicates, parity pinned by test),
with a cold cache paying one threaded whole-file load. The cost is per-completion loop time
invisible to the standing HTTP probes, so the collector copies the session whose live chat file
carries the most events into a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp (metadata.json and data/
only; live home read once for the copy, never written), warms the cache as the chain's first
judgment does, and times both judgments back to back with a concurrent 5 ms ticker, from the
checkout under test — one cold pass, as at the first finalize after a server start, then five
timed rounds. The collector dispatches on the fold methods' presence: a checkout without them

M77 — session-switch projection reuse, rotating tabs. Every SPA switch re-reads the
session through the message projection (view, bootstrap, events page), whose per-session
LRU window must cover the tabs' rotation breadth: a re-entry past the window re-pays the
M26 cold build. The collector resolves the 12 active live sessions carrying the most
events (the rotation is wider than the pre-fix window of 8), warms every projection once
as the tabs' first visits do, then times 3 rounds of re-entries over the rotation,
counting the re-entries that re-built (a rebuild parses the corpus; a warm hit is a dict
read + len compare, so the 1 ms split is unambiguous). Live home read-only; from the

M78 — ndjson event parse, cold whole-file. The events cache, the M13 worker-events

M79 — git branches list, steady state. The /diff viewer's branch picker fetches
``GET /api/git/branches`` on every page open; each fetch ran one ``git branch -a
--sort=-committerdate`` subprocess to recompute a listing that is a pure function
of the repo's ref state — the ref set (a branch add/remove/rename renames a loose
ref file or rewrites packed-refs), every listed branch's committerdate (a ref
value change rewrites its file), and HEAD all publish through the ref mutations
the ref-state signature already covers, so an unchanged signature proves the
listing current. The listing cost grows with the ref count, and the ref count
grows one file per branch this workflow leaves behind (2,718 refs at the
landing measurement, 852 loose), an unbounded trend like the one the M41 row
documented for the resolution walk. The fixed handler serves a repeat listing
from a bounded memo keyed on (repo, ref-state signature) — the ref-resolution
memo's own key shape — with the signature walk and any subprocess in one thread
hop. The cost is per picker open, invisible to the standing HTTP probes, so the
collector drives the ``list_branches`` handler over the charlie-bot checkout
(read-only, scratch ``CHARLIEBOT_HOME``), from the checkout under test: the
first view, as at a picker open with a cold memo, then seven timed repeats,
with the served-list digest so a corpus difference between arms cannot
masquerade as a payload difference. Evidence points the same collector at the
before and after checkouts (``CHECKOUT`` at each root), the same shape as the
M41 protocol:

M80 — token-tally changed round under append churn. The tally's cached parse re-read a moved
log file whole, so the /token-usage page paid a whole-transcript re-read for every file an
active turn appended to since the last collect — the production p90 the M80 definition row
quotes, invisible to the standing M7 probes (the warm page and the quiet changed round read 0
moved files). The fixed parse proves the unchanged prefix from a guard hash of its final
window plus the boundary newline and parses only the appended tail. The cost is the
busy-turn page load, so the collector copies the worst claude transcript and the worst codex
rollout into a scratch corpus (live home read once for the copy, never written), cold-collects
to build the cache, appends the corpus's own final ~1 MB (line-aligned, verbatim replay lines)

M81 — chat math-walk, delimiter gate. `renderChatMath` runs the KaTeX auto-render walk over every
`.prose-msg` on every message re-render and the streamed paint runs it over the whole draft on
every coalesced paint; the walk scans every prose text node for the four delimiters even when the
message carries no math — M60's repeat-page metric and M33's replay stubbed exactly this walk, so
neither standing number saw it. The gate skips the walk when the message's own source (the
streamed draft text, else the `.prose-msg[data-raw]` source) carries none of the three delimiter
initials (`$`, `\(`, `\[`), and any character reference (which the browser decodes into the
walk's text nodes) forces it, so the skip is byte-identical. The cost is client-side, invisible
to every HTTP probe, so the collector loads the checkout's real renderer code with the page's
CDN-pinned katex 0.16.21 build over a jsdom DOM (one-time scratch install
`npm i --prefix /tmp jsdom@24`, resolved through `JSDOM_HOME`, default /tmp/node_modules) and
times the walk through the page's own call shapes over the live corpora (read-only): the worst
message page (the M60 corpus — the 40 largest assistant bodies of the live chat file carrying
the most bytes) and the largest math-free streamed draft at the coalesced paint cadence. Evidence
points the collector at the before and after checkouts (`CHECKOUT` at each root), the same shape
as the M33 protocol:

```bash
CHECKOUT=${CHECKOUT:-/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot}; node "$CHECKOUT/tests/katex_walk_collector.js"
```

M82 — worker events-log append, per event. Every worker event (text delta, tool use, tool result,
thinking) lands through the streamed-turn loop's per-event append before its broadcast, so the
append's executor-hop count rides the same path the chat-event append (M52) rides. The collector
copies no state: it appends one probe event to a scratch worker log under /tmp through the
checkout's real append shape — the run holds one append handle for its whole life, so the timed
shape is the per-event append exactly as the streamed-turn loop issues it (the checkout decides
between the pre-fix aiofiles write+flush pair and the one-hop helper; the dispatch reads the
module, and the probe line is the checkout's own ``_event_line`` output — the persisted shape,
bytes since the streamed-turn landing — so a line-shape change can never desync the collector).
One warm pass, as a run's first events, then 50 timed appends. Evidence points the same

M83 — versioned static-asset revalidation, warm page load. Every template-referenced asset URL
carries ``?v=<static_asset_version>`` (the runtime git version plus the served tree's content
digest, refreshed per page render, so the token tracks the bytes the URL serves even when a
working-tree edit lands between restarts), but the static mount served default caching, so the
browser revalidated all of them on every page load — one If-None-Match round trip plus ~0.5 ms
of serve work per asset (46 assets, ~21 ms of serve work per page load measured), on exactly the
files the latency loop edits most often. The fixed mount marks a 200 response whose request
named a version ``public, max-age=31536000, immutable`` — a response that named its version
names its content — so a warm-cache page load issues zero asset requests; a request without a
version parameter keeps default caching because its URL can outlive its content, and a 304
keeps the cached 200's own headers. The cost is per-page-load latency and serve CPU
invisible to the standing HTTP probes, so the collector resolves the dashboard's template asset
set from the checkout and drives each asset through the real app stack (gzip + auth middleware)
raw-ASGI: one cold pass (first load, 200), then five revalidation-shaped requests per asset,
reporting the per-asset wall and the page-load serve work the pre-fix shape multiplied into;
the warm-cache revalidation-request count reads off the header's presence. Evidence points the

M84 — backend stream-line parse, worst on-disk raw log. The backend stream
funnels parse every streamed line of every covered backend's turn: the raw-log
tail-follow loop (the live and re-attach read side of the claude-family
backends) and the spawned-stdout NDJSON reader (the codex/opencode run loops)
in ``src/agents/backends/base.py``, the opencode SSE payload reader, and the
anthropic proxy's upstream chunk reader. The funnels' parser cost is invisible
to the standing HTTP probes (it rides the stream loop, not a request), so the
collector resolves the largest ``agent.raw.ndjson`` under the sessions root,
copies it to a scratch directory (live home read once for the copy, never
written), and replays it through the real funnel functions — the tail-follow
loop with a counting translate and a dead producer, the stdout reader over the
same lines — one cold pass then seven timed replays per funnel; the cursor
advance is disabled, so the replay writes nothing anywhere. A pre-pass asserts
parser parity: stdlib json and the funnels' parser must agree on every line of
the corpus (0 divergences), which is also the boundary claim's standing
evidence. Evidence while a change is under review points the same collector at

M85 — verify-finalize report read, steady state. Every verify worker's finalize chain
(`spawner_finalize._verify_report_for_task`, on the worker finalize and again on the
startup-reconcile replay) runs `read_verify_final_report` over the verify thread's events
log, and the pre-fix reader full-parsed the whole log (`parse_ndjson_file`) to scan its
last events — ~13.5 ms on the 6.7 MB worst on-disk log — although the RESULT event the
report quotes sits at the log tail on every on-disk verify thread. The fixed reader walks
512 KiB segments from the end through `iter_ndjson_events_from_end` (the M31
`parse_ndjson_tail_parseable` mechanics, now the shared generator under it), stopping once
both judgments settle — the last result event's payload, or the first non-empty assistant
text from the end; identical output, blank and malformed lines never counting in
either form. The cost is finalize-path thread time invisible to HTTP probes, so the
collector times the function the finalize chain awaits over the largest on-disk worker
log (read-only), from the checkout under test: one cold pass, as at first finalize after
a server start, then five timed calls. Evidence while the live server runs older code

M86 — delegation takeoff-gate scan, delegation-flow shape. Every
`/api/internal/delegate` and `/api/internal/improve` POST runs
`check_takeoff_gate` over the delegating session's whole chat history (the
delegation target is always the busiest master session), on the default
executor pool. The pre-scan form walked every event and re-normalized every
real user message's full content on each call — O(history) per delegation,
growing with the master session without bound. The current form reads the
verdict's two answers (the file-last real user message's takeoff phrase, the
file-last parseable pre-takeoff stamp) through an answers memo keyed on the
chat-events cache's list identity: a cold or replaced list pays one full
backward walk with no early break (the stored answers must be complete prefix
facts), and an appended suffix folds by scanning only the suffix — a user
message in the suffix is the new file-last one, and the prefix's stored stamp
answer is the file-older bound the backward continuation would stop at — so a
steady-state call is a memo read plus an O(appended-since-last-call) scan
while the verdict stays the forward walk's. The cost is thread-pool time on
the spawn path, invisible to the
standing HTTP probes, so the collector copies the session whose live chat file
carries the most events into a scratch `CHARLIEBOT_HOME` under /tmp
(metadata.json and data/ only; live home read once for the copy, never
written), times nine warm calls over the corpus as it stands (the parity
witness — its verdict is whatever the live state is, reported not asserted),
then appends the delegation-flow shape — one authorized real user message, the
take-off instruction a delegate POST follows — and times nine warm calls,
asserting the allowed verdict:

M87 — opencode abort client round-trip. `_abort_session` runs at every
opencode turn's cleanup (and `terminate`), posting to the run's local serve;
the run-start client (`_check_health` through the SSE stream) pays the same
per-call construction. httpx builds a fresh default SSL context per
AsyncClient when `verify` is left at its default — ~20 ms of event-loop CPU
per construction on this host, paid twice per opencode turn — while the serve
URL is plain localhost HTTP and never uses the context for TLS. The cost is
turn-boundary event-loop work invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector

``_build_direct_pass_gzip``: a full parse validating the file, then a stream-compress of the
original bytes — so the build wall is user-visible first-view latency (the cache answers repeat
views). The cost is background executor work invisible to HTTP probes, so the collector times

M89 — backend stderr tee, per chunk. Every covered backend's run tees subprocess stderr to the
run's stderr.log (0.6-4 MB on disk per run) through the streamed loop's per-chunk write before
the in-memory tail update, and the tee's executor-hop count is invisible to the HTTP probes
above. The collector drives the per-chunk tee exactly as the pump issues it — a scratch
stderr.log under /tmp, 8 KB chunks, one warm pass then 50 timed tees — through the tee's
module-level write, read as a direct attribute so a renamed helper fails the collector instead
of silently timing a removed shape, the same shape as the M82 protocol. Evidence points the
same collector at the before and after checkouts (``CHECKOUT`` at each root):

M90 — backend stdout pump, per chunk or startup line. The opencode run tees `opencode serve`'s
stdout through the streamed pump (the startup wait appends each printed line, then the pump
writes every 8 KB chunk), and the antigravity envelope pump writes its whole stdout the same
way; the claude-family backends' raw stdout lands through the spawn fd, so those runs pay no
per-chunk write. The collector drives both shapes exactly as the pump issues them — a scratch
stdout.log under /tmp, 8 KB chunks and one printed line, one warm pass then 50 timed writes
each — through the pumps' module-level write, read as a direct attribute so a renamed helper

M91 — worker per-event quota-scan head, streamed-turn replay. The worker's
`_process_event` runs per streamed event on the worker's loop beside the append
and broadcast; its quota-pattern check read both payload fields through
`str().lower()` copies on every event although only ERROR events can match. The
collector drives the real `_process_event` in file order over the worst on-disk
worker events log (read-only) with the append pointed at a scratch log under
/tmp (the run's held-fd shape, the M82 collector's) and the real broadcast
manager (zero subscribers), timing each call: one cold pass, as at a run's
first event, then five timed replays. The worst single event carries the scan
(the corpus's biggest payload); the per-event median reads the append floor the
M82 row documents and is expected to hold.

M92 — CLI invocation startup, common-family command. Every `charliebot` invocation is a
fresh Python process, and the master and workers run several per turn (memory queries,
plan verbs, delegate, schedule-trigger), so the shared module's import chain is the
per-call floor they all pay. The collector times `schedule-trigger --help` — argparse
exits before any request, so the reading is pure import+dispatch, deterministic, and
independent of server state — with the checkout under test resolved cwd-first (the
editable-install finder sits behind PathFinder, so a subprocess with cwd at the
checkout imports that checkout's code). `CHECKOUT` at the worktree root reads the
branch, the same shape as the M18 protocol:

```bash
CHECKOUT=${CHECKOUT:-/home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot} /home/chaoli/workspace/charlie-bot/.venv/bin/python - <<'EOF'
import os, subprocess, sys, time

CHECKOUT = os.environ["CHECKOUT"]

def wall(args):
    t0 = time.perf_counter()
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-c", CODE, *args], cwd=CHECKOUT,
                   stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, check=True)

```

M93 — thread-detail 500s. The workers panel polls `GET /api/threads/{sid}/threads/{tid}`
(`?attach=1` every 5 s per expanded thread row, full row on click); a 500 here fails that
poll continuously while the panel is open and each failure ships a ~30-line traceback into
the server log beside the structured `http_request … status=500` line the count matches.
The count reads the newest server log (its filename carries the server start time) and
appends `|| [ $? -eq 1 ]` for the same reason M11's count does: `grep -c` exits 1 on the
healthy zero count, and a real grep failure (exit 2) must stay loud:

```bash
LOG=$(ls -1t /tmp/charliebot-logs/server_*.log | head -1); grep -cE "method=GET path=/api/threads/[0-9a-f-]+/threads/[0-9a-f-]+ status=500" "$LOG" || [ $? -eq 1 ]
```

M94 — projection page + stream-delta serialization, giant-tool-output corpus. One message's
`tools` array rides every render path: each page payload (bootstrap, events, view) and each
`stream` delta re-serializes the whole buffered draft, so an unbounded tool row turns one big
tool_result into megabytes on every page build and every switch back to the session (the live
log's worst bootstrap tail: 890 ms, session 4914c102's 9.92 MB Bash output). Every chat wire
shape carries the renderer's preview bound (TOOL_PREVIEW_CHARS, trimmed at ingestion — the
stream delta, the committed message behind the events pages, and the bootstrap payload); the
persisted event keeps the full text. The collector resolves the active session whose live chat file carries the largest single
`tool_result` content (live home read-only; the projection build and the aggregator feed are
pure), builds the projection, times the tail-40 page's json.dumps, and replays the corpus through
the live broadcast shape (one json.dumps per emitted delta). Evidence points the same collector at
the before and after checkouts (`CHECKOUT` at each root), the same shape as the M7 protocol:

M95 — worker-log newest-first scans: the reviewer-completion worker-summary scan and the failed
improve iteration's judgment pair. Both scan the worker's events log newest-first and stop at the
first answer — the review scan at the first non-empty result-or-assistant text, the pair at the
first quota-shaped event (or exhaustion) plus the first summary text — so a corpus whose answer
sits in the tail never reads the older bytes, and the pair's no-match exhaustion is the one shape
that parses the whole log (the metric's floor). The cost is thread-pool time invisible to HTTP
probes, so the collector resolves the largest on-disk worker log (read-only), one cold pass per
shape, then five timed rounds of each shape, from the checkout under test. Evidence while the live
server runs older code points the same collector at the branch checkout (``CHECKOUT`` at the

M96 — switch-bootstrap chat payload, active-session sweep. The SPA switch
(`switchSession`, web/static/js/sidebar/session-view.js) fetches
``GET /api/sessions/{id}/bootstrap`` inside its started→completed window (the
index page's embedded SESSION_BOOTSTRAP is the same payload), and the live
``diag_switch`` telemetry (1751 switched sessions per 40 h on the 2026-09-12
log, joined to their bootstrap server lines) reads: server 6 % of the switch,
client transfer + parse + mount 94 % — median 164 ms elapsed against a 14 ms
server call. The payload's weight is the messages' ``tools`` arrays (95 % of the
body before the trim), each carrying whole input and output although the
renderer displays only a bounded preview (an output's first 500 characters
plain, an input's summary line — 80 chars for Bash, 60 for other named tools,
the full file path/pattern for the file tools) inside a block hidden behind the
"N tool calls" toggle, inside turns that mostly render folded. The collector
measures the body bytes of every active session's bootstrap (live home
read-only); the healthy range is set from the post-trim body. Evidence while the
live server runs older code is a scratch-instance A/B: live-before GETs against
the running server, scratch-after GETs through a TestClient on the changed
checkout with a scratch ``CHARLIEBOT_HOME`` holding the same active sessions
(metadata + data, ``master_runs`` excluded), asserting every message's
non-tools fields byte-identical across arms and every trimmed tool a strict
prefix with its truncation marker set.

M97 — plan-CLI command wall, common-family verb.
