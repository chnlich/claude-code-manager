  ``log`` emits *event* with *fields* through *emit* the first time the

  repeat re-fires a fired alarm rather than earning a second line. A call
  site derives *key* from exactly the fields the line logs, so a change in
  what is reported earns one new line, and nothing outside the log statement
  can drift the key away from what was reported.

  ``clear`` forgets every key and ``forget_where`` forgets the keys a
  predicate accepts, so a later sighting earns one new line again. A
  consumer re-arms the whole registry when a successful read ends every
  broken streak, or one alarm's keys when it ends one streak; tests restore
  the process-start state with ``clear``.
